# Formula 1 Circuit Construction  
### Project Management & Systems Planning Case Study

This project presents a structured project management case study for the construction of a Formula 1 racing circuit.  
It was developed as part of a university course and focuses on **planning, coordination, and control of a large-scale, complex engineering project**.

---

## Project Overview

The construction of a Formula 1 circuit is a highly complex endeavor involving:
- Strict deadlines
- High safety and regulatory requirements
- Multiple stakeholders
- Significant budget and resource constraints

This project analyzes and plans the full lifecycle of such a project, from initiation to delivery.

---

## Project Scope

The case study covers:
- Definition of project objectives and deliverables
- Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)
- Scheduling and milestone planning
- Resource allocation
- Cost estimation and budgeting
- Risk identification and mitigation strategies

The goal is to demonstrate systematic project planning under realistic constraints.

---

## Planning & Management Approach

The project applies standard project management practices, including:
- Phased project lifecycle planning
- Task dependencies and critical path considerations
- Time and cost trade-off analysis
- Risk assessment and contingency planning

All decisions are justified based on feasibility, constraints, and project priorities.

---

## Key Constraints & Challenges

- Fixed completion deadlines
- High safety and compliance standards
- Coordination of parallel work streams
- Dependency management between construction phases
- Budget control under uncertainty

These constraints reflect challenges commonly encountered in real-world infrastructure and engineering projects.

## Documentation

- Detailed project management report (PDF)
- Project schedules and timelines
- Risk analysis and planning documentation

> **Note:**  
> The original documentation is written in Greek, as this project was developed within the context of a university course.

## Relevance to Data & Systems Roles

Although not a software project, this case study demonstrates skills that are critical for data and AI roles:
- Structured problem decomposition
- Planning under uncertainty
- Stakeholder and resource management
- Systems-level thinking

Such skills are essential for delivering data-driven projects in production environments.
